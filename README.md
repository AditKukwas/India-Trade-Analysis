# India-Trade-Analysis
This project involved analyzing India's export and import data using SQL queries and creating interactive dashboards using Power BI.

**The objectives of the project were:**
1. Finding country with which India has highest trade over the years.
2. Finding Top 3 trading partners of India over the years.
3. Finding Most and least Exported and imported commodity each year.
4. Analyzing increment in trade between India and Quad countries over the years.
5. Analyzing increment in trade between India and it's top trading partners such as China and Saudi Arabia.
6. Building a dashboard in Power BI for the KPI's above.

The project showcases the use of SQL, and Power BI for data analysis and visualization, and provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about these tools and techniques.

SQL To extract relevant data from the India Trade dataset, SQL queries were executed using the following keywords:

SELECT to retrieve data from specific columns, FROM to specify the table to retrieve data from, WHERE to filter data based on specific conditions, GROUP BY to group data based on specific columns, ORDER BY to sort data in ascending or descending order, SUBQUERY to filter columns and aggregated function such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK and DENSE_RANK.

Power BI To visualize and analyze the Zomato restaurant data, Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards. The following features and functions were utilized:

Data modeling using relationships between tables and calculated columns Measures and DAX formulas to perform calculations on the data Visualizations such as tables, charts, and maps to display the data Slicers and filters to enable dynamic filtering of the data Drill-through functionality to navigate between different levels of detail in the data.

**Insights obtained from this project are:**
1. Discover the country with which India has the highest trade volume over the years. This insight can help understand the dynamics of international trade relationships.
2. Identify the top three trading partners of India over the years. This information is crucial for assessing India's economic partnerships and trade strategies.
3. Analyze the increase in trade between India and Quad countries over the years. This insight can provide information about India's engagement with regional trading blocs.
4. Study the growth in trade between India and its significant trading partners, such as China and Saudi Arabia. Understanding trade relations with these countries is necessary for economic analysis.
5. By analyzing trade deficits over multiple years, the project can provide insights into whether the deficits are widening or narrowing and can inform policymakers and trade experts about areas that may need attention
6. The interactive dashboard Power BI allow users to explore the data in a user-friendly way. Users can apply filters and drill down into specific aspects of the data to uncover insights that fit their needs.

Here is the images showcasing the Power BI dashboard I have created.
